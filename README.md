## 📈 Features Created

- `Frequency`: Number of unique purchases per customer
- `Monetary`: Total spend by each customer
- `Cluster`: Segment label assigned by K-Means

---

## 🚀 Results

Customers were segmented into 4 groups:
- 🎯 **High-value frequent buyers**
- 💸 **Low-frequency high spenders**
- 💤 **Infrequent low spenders**
- 📦 **Average-value regular customers**

These clusters support **targeted promotions**, **loyalty programs**, and **resource optimization** in marketing.
